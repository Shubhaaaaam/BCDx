## About The Project

This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis and visualization of a breast cancer diagnostic dataset. The primary goal is to understand the characteristics of different features, identify correlations between them, and visualize patterns that could potentially distinguish between malignant and benign cases.

The `Untitled.ipynb` notebook provides a step-by-step analysis, including data loading, basic statistics, distribution plots, and correlation matrices. If a Flask application is part of this project, it aims to serve these visualizations dynamically.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `data.csv`, which is a commonly used Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. It contains various features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The `diagnosis` column indicates whether the tumor is Malignant (M) or Benign (B).

### Built With

* Python
* Pandas - For data manipulation and analysis.
* NumPy - For numerical operations.
* Matplotlib - For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
* Seaborn - For statistical data visualization built on Matplotlib.
* Jupyter Notebook - For interactive data exploration and analysis.
* Flask (Potentially, if serving plots via a web app)
* ydata-profiling (Potentially, for automated data reports)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x and `pip` installed.

* Python 3.x
* pip

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Shubhaaaaam/BCDx.git](https://github.com/Shubhaaaaam/BCDx.git)
    cd BCDx
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    It's recommended to create a `requirements.txt` file first if you don't have one:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
    Then, install:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Alternatively, you can install the main libraries directly:*
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter ydata-profiling flask
    ```

## Usage

### Exploring the Data

* **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook BCDx.ipynb
    ```
    This will open the Jupyter interface in your browser, where you can navigate to and run `Untitled.ipynb` to execute the data analysis steps.

### Generating Reports (if `ydata-profiling` is used)

If you are using `ydata-profiling` for comprehensive data reports, you can generate an HTML report like this within a Python script or Jupyter cell:

```python
import pandas as pd
from ydata_profiling import ProfileReport

# Assuming 'data.csv' is in your project root or accessible path
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
profile = ProfileReport(df, title="Breast Cancer Diagnostic Data Report")
profile.to_file("bcdx_data_report.html")
