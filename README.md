## About The Project

This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis and visualization of a breast cancer diagnostic dataset. The primary goal is to understand the characteristics of different features, identify correlations between them, and visualize patterns that could potentially distinguish between malignant and benign cases.

The `Untitled.ipynb` notebook provides a step-by-step analysis, including data loading, basic statistics, distribution plots, and correlation matrices. If a Flask application is part of this project, it aims to serve these visualizations dynamically.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `data.csv`, which is a commonly used Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. It contains various features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The `diagnosis` column indicates whether the tumor is Malignant (M) or Benign (B).

### Built With

* Python
* Pandas - For data manipulation and analysis.
* NumPy - For numerical operations.
* Matplotlib - For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
* Seaborn - For statistical data visualization built on Matplotlib.
* Jupyter Notebook - For interactive data exploration and analysis.
* Flask (Potentially, if serving plots via a web app)
* ydata-profiling (Potentially, for automated data reports)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x and `pip` installed.

* Python 3.x
* pip

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Shubhaaaaam/BCDx.git](https://github.com/Shubhaaaaam/BCDx.git)
    cd BCDx
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    It's recommended to create a `requirements.txt` file first if you don't have one:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
    Then, install:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Alternatively, you can install the main libraries directly:*
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter ydata-profiling flask
    ```

## Usage

### Exploring the Data

* **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook BCDx.ipynb
    ```
    This will open the Jupyter interface in your browser, where you can navigate to and run `Untitled.ipynb` to execute the data analysis steps.

### Generating Reports (if `ydata-profiling` is used)

If you are using `ydata-profiling` for comprehensive data reports, you can generate an HTML report like this within a Python script or Jupyter cell:

```python
import pandas as pd
from ydata_profiling import ProfileReport

# Assuming 'data.csv' is in your project root or accessible path
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
profile = ProfileReport(df, title="Breast Cancer Diagnostic Data Report")
profile.to_file("bcdx_data_report.html")
```
## Getting Started

This section explains how to set up your project locally.

### Prerequisites

List any software or libraries that users need to have installed before running your project.

* Python 3.x
* pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

Step-by-step instructions on how to get your development environment running.

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, you can create one by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing all your dependencies.*
    *Alternatively, list individual installs:*
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter ydata-profiling flask
    ```

## Usage

Explain how to use your project. Provide examples.

* **To run the Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and analysis:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Untitled.ipynb
    ```
* **To generate a full data profiling report (if `ydata-profiling` is used):**
    ```python
    # In a Python script or Jupyter cell
    import pandas as pd
    from ydata_profiling import ProfileReport

    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
    profile = ProfileReport(df, title="Data Analysis Report")
    profile.to_file("data_report.html")
    ```
* **To run the Flask application (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    Then open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

## Plots and Visualizations

Describe or show key visualizations generated by your project. If you have a web application, you might link to screenshots or live demos. If you generated specific HTML files (like `plot_correlation.html`), mention them here.

* **Column Distributions:** Visualizations showing the distribution of values for each column.
* **Correlation Matrix:** A heatmap showing the correlations between numerical features (e.g., in `plot_correlation.html` if generated separately).
* **Scatter Matrix:** Pair plots to visualize relationships between multiple variables.
